This repository has 24 ARIMA and ARIMAX models which forecasts short-term 
influenza-related hospitalizations in 48 states of the contiguous U.S. 
It also includes a CDC FluSight baseline model adapted to our work.

########################################################################

Our main folder has a Rmakdown that generates images and analysis for our 24 models:
manuscript_results.Rmd

It also has a Rmarkdown which generates images and analysis comparing the models and the FLuSight baseline.
flusight_comparison.Rmd

#########################################################################
There are 4 subfolders in our main folder: 

ERA5 data: which has the code for treating the temperature and humidity data which we later use in some of our models and analysis.
models_with_logback: which has the models that use log-back transformations.  
models_without_logback: which has the models that do not use log-back transformations.
Flusight-baseline-adapted: which has the CDC FluSight baseline which we adapted to our work.

In each of our models folders we have a Rmakrdown which process the NHSH hospitalizations dataset to a format that we can use. 
We also have a few additional datasets which we used for modeling or analysis (shapefiles and regression_features), 
which we decriped on our methods section.

Moreover, on each of our models folders we have 5 major model families each on a different subfolder.

ES_ARIMA: Ensembles and single best ARIMA models. 
ES_TEMPERATURE: Ensembles and single best ARIMAX models using 1-week-lag mean state temperature as covariate.
ES_EPIWEEK: Ensembles and single best ARIMAX models using 1-week-lag mean cases by epidemiological week for the as covariate. Value calculated for the previous 2 years.
ES_ADJACENT: Ensembles and single best ARIMAX models with 1-week-lag using mean hospitalizations in adjacent states as covariate.
ES_AVERAGE: Ensembles and single best ARIMAX models with 1-week-lag using average of hospitalizations across the U.S as covariate.

#########

Each model family subfolder have the results of 3 model types: AUTO, ES27 and ES64. 
AUTO is a non-ensemble model which uses the best automatic fitting model. 
The other 2 model types are ensembles which combine 27 or 64 ARIMA or ARIMAX models. 
These results are loaded and evaluated in the "manuscript_results.Rmd" file,
and on the "flusight_comparison.Rmd" file.
